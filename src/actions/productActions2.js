/// bussiness logic of the programs returns AN ACTION OBJECT to the DISPATCH() method which in turn returns to all the reducers.

//Note: distpatch is just an argument name hence you can use any name instead of dispatch.
// Since fetchProducts is higher order function, make sure parameter for dispatch is a function.

// NOTE: all reducer's actions  takes a_function_as_argument  and returns another_functions
// like here fetchProducts() is getting dispatch_action as input and returning another dispatch_action as output.

/*
!!! IMPORTANT CONCEPT !!! HERE ATTACHING DISPATCH() TO THE PROPS SO THAT ACTION CAN BE BROADCASTED TO THE REDUCERS
- Dispactch() always take object input which should contain actionType and in most cases payload also.

// These functions or actions are those functions which redux uses to dispatch actions.
// Redux passes the action_Object(object containing the action and the payload) to all the reducers inside their switch case as action.
// whichever actions get matched,

// ? where is dispatch coming from
// it could be just any function takes an object as argument and it could have any name.
// it is not special function which we are importing from somewhere.
